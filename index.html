        <p>Hi, I'm Joseph Choi. I am a second year student in the UofM School of Information, and I'm interested in
            accessible web development and
            data science! I started college planning on majoring in computer science, but after taking both EECS and SI
            classes, I realized I wanted to study something more people-oriented.
            I see the School of Information's interdisciplinary focus on technology and people as a better fit for my
            passions and goals. I am most interested in studying data analysis or user experience, to pursue a career
            in information technology. I am fascinated by the ways in which information technology can more than
            impersonal problem solving, and how it can be human-oriented and exciting. My shift from CS to Information
            was caused by a love for people and problem solving in a people-oriented way.
            <br>
            I currently work at University of Michigan ITS as a Tech Consultant. I provide technical support for 
            customersâ€™ personal devices and Campus Computing Site technology, which allows me to combine my technical
            expertise with my desire to work with and help people.

        </p>
