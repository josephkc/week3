        <h1>Hi! I'm Joseph</h1>
        <div class="shortsec">
            <p class="shortdesc">
                I am a second year student at the University of Michigan, and I'm interested in
                accessible web development and
                data science! When I started college, I was planning on majoring in computer science, but after taking
                both EECS and SI
                classes, I realized I wanted to study something more people-oriented.
                <br><br>
                I see the School of Information's interdisciplinary focus on technology and people as a perfect fit for
                my
                passions and goals. I am most interested in studying accessibility in user experience, to pursue a
                career
                in user experience design. I am fascinated by the ways in which information technology can more than
                impersonal problem solving, and how it can be human-oriented and exciting. My shift from CS to
                Information
                was caused by a love for people and problem solving in a people-oriented way.
                <br><br>
                I currently work at University of Michigan ITS as a Tech Consultant. I provide technical support for
                customers’ personal devices and Campus Computing Site technology, which allows me to combine my
                technical
                expertise with my desire to work with and help people.
